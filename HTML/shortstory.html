    <p style="font-size: 60px;color: brown;text-align: center;">Trip to Moab, Utah</p>
    <p style="font-size: 25px;color:indigo;">Since I am a nature lover, I like to visit new places. One of the ones I liked the most is <b>Moab</b>. It is located about 220 miles southeast of Salt Lake. <br>In <i><strong>Arches Park</strong></i> you can see different sandstone formations that are impressive where the force of nature over a long time is evident. </p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;color: blue;text-align: center;text-decoration:underline;">If you like <mark>hiking</mark>, a visit to this park is a must if you live in Utah or its surroundings.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 30px;font-weight: lighter;">During my trip to Moab I also had the opportunity to navigate the rapids of the Colorado River and appreciate the canyon and its landscapes.</p>
    <p style="font-style: italic;">So if you want to enjoy a little outdoor adventure, <strong>Moab</strong> is a highly recommended place.</p>
